Pandas has quickly became an important tool in a data professional's toolbelt and is the most popular library for working with tabular data in Python. Tabular data is any data that can be represented as rows and columns. \n","\n","To represent tabular data, Pandas uses a custom data structure called a **DataFrame**. A DataFrame is a highly efficient, 2-dimensional data structure that provides a suite of methods and attributes to quickly explore, analyze, and visualize data. The DataFrame is similar to the NumPy 2D array but adds support for many features that help you work with tabular data.\n","\n","One of the biggest advantages that Pandas has over NumPy is the **ability to store mixed data types** in rows and columns. Many tabular datasets contain a range of data types and Pandas DataFrames handle mixed data types effortlessly while NumPy doesn't. Pandas DataFrames **can also handle missing values gracefully** using a custom object, **NaN**, to represent those values. A common complaint with NumPy is its lack of an object to represent missing values and people end up having to find and replace these values manually. In addition, pandas DataFrames contain axis labels for both rows and columns and enable you to refer to elements in the dataframe more intuitively. Since many tabular datasets contain column titles, this means that dataframes preserve the metadata from the file around the data.\n","\n","To get things started, we have to load Pandas library:"]},{"metadata":{"id":"_1mlLpqL5C9S","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"WvsgK9yk5Dmf","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Our case study\n","\n","In this part of the course, you'll learn the basics of pandas while exploring several datasets [Dados Abertos Natal](http://dados.natal.br/).

The loc[] method allows you to select rows by row labels. Recall that when you read a file into a dataframe, pandas uses the row number (or position) as each row's label. Pandas uses zero-indexing, so the first row is at index 0, the second row at index 1, and so on.\n","If you're interested in accessing a single row, pass in the row label to the loc[] method.
